        Graduates are speaking. Recommended to spend time solving an algo a day and updating it to github, Github repos are a good way to showcase that your actually working on code after you graduate as well as showcasing that you understand algos and how they work and function. 

        Theres an alternative focus on the projects and algos section. Some on project, some on algos. 

        Basic Team Meeting Setup 
            What did you finish? 
            What are you planning to work on today?
            What do you need help with?
            Meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.
            Have a code review setup. By me most likely, review and test the code with the individual. 


        Post Graduation Advice 

            Study algos together with the squad
            Take point on that give everyone a week, afterwards, plan for that. And then get that taken care of.
            Hard work is not over once the dojo is finished. 
            Keep in contact with the team, keep us focused keep us together, make it happen. 
            Assume the same kind of time commitment after graduation. Set a realistic time frame for how long the job search will be. A year is not a bad estimation of time.
